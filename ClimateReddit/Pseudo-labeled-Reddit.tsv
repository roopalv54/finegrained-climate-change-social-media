5	/r/climateskeptics/comments/79zlvg/climate_change_to_make_volcanoes_more_climate/dps4uzw/	I've never claimed there is no consensus. What topic related to climate change would you like to discuss?	1	1
6	/r/climateskeptics/comments/aphews/top_scientist_resigns_global_warming_is_a/egbbjz4/	But you're telling us to think that climate change is a trillion dollar scam.	1	-1

8	/r/climate/comments/mmdcrt/revealed_the_climateconflicted_directors_leading/gtrju2f/	They did nothing about the climate except lie about it and they've known that climate change will kill off humans and other species since last century. So it's definite doing nothing doesn't work. Time to get off their asses and fix climate destruction.	1	1
9	/r/climate/comments/9bhlmw/scientifically_backed_end_of_the_worldclimate/e53hcw0/	 'Downsizing' is weirdly accurate as far as climate change goes. They shrink people to live in tiny homes to reduce emissions The magic shrinking people ray, not so accurate but the rest is spot on	1	1

11	/r/climatechange/comments/fpy17h/no2_emissions_drop_with_lockdown/fm0jac8/	 Even if NO2 is not a greenhouse gas, it is a great indicator of the rate at which transportation and the heavy industry are burning fossil fuels. Therefore a great indicator of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and other greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change.	1	1
12	/r/climatechange/comments/i3m4u0/climate_related_deaths_are_dropping_so_climate/g0jg13x/	Well building standards have improved. So has medical science. What a pathetic argumemt against climate change.	1	1

14	/r/climatechange/comments/p8jhy6/where_are_the_safest_places_in_china_that_could/h9wk061/	 Well climate change predictions showcase sea level rise as much as several hundred feet. If all ice melts, it'll rise sea level by over 200 feet.	3	1
16	/r/ClimateActionPlan/comments/cnk8ku/farming_and_eating_need_to_change_to_curb_global/ewds7mw/	 Even without climate change, it's extremely doubtful we'll ever hit 20 billion humans let alone even 15 billion. 50 100 billion is just impossible unless we decide to populate Antarctica and the Sahara.	1	1
17	/r/climate/comments/q912mk/solving_the_climate_crisis_requires_the_end_of/hgtmqor/	 So the rest of climate change (destruction of ecosystems, extinctions of species, refugee crises, breakdown of food systems) just is not at all worth solving?	1	1
18	/r/climateskeptics/comments/emalne/love_you_guys/fdnfpqq/	 The fires were so bad due to land mismanagement and greenies disrupting control burns and outlawing private firebreaks. Greenie policy causes a problem, blame it on climate change to put more greenie policies in place rinse and repeat	5	1
19	/r/climateskeptics/comments/cemqqj/apollo_astronauts_climate_skeptics_astronauts/eu5ne44/	&gt; It's not that the experts working at nasa deny climate change. There's nobody who denies climate change. You must be living in some alternative universe.	1	1
20	/r/climateskeptics/comments/9g379m/meteorologist_fact_checks_bill_nye_on_whether/e6173ci/	 They used one thermometer with two different temperatures because there was no result to show. I'm not concerned about climate in any way, no need to replicate anything. How has climate change affected you personally?	1	1
21	/r/climate/comments/f6b0ka/redstate_utah_embraces_plan_to_tackle_climate/fi3lfi6/	“Surprising” to no one paying any attention to what’s going on. When your tourism dollars come from ski slopes and national parks that feel climate change the most you better believe changes will be made.	1	1
22	/r/climatechange/comments/dvq5ez/need_help_with_this_website_arguing_against/f7e3nl5/	 If you are writing a science report, why are you bothering with some random website? The facts on climate change are published by the IPCC. There is no need to consider the thoughts of Some Dude on the Internet (including me).	1	1
23	/r/ClimateActionPlan/comments/fce5fu/plastic_free_and_refillable_way_forward_with_food/fjakznr/	Hi I think this relates to climate change via decreasing emissions since packaging will be highly reduced company wide if this is adopted more widely. Please reinstate my post and I can make that more explicit in the title.	1	1

27	/r/climatechange/comments/owfpo7/tehran_and_much_of_iran_slowly_sinking_land/h7gagmm/	 This really doesn't have anything to do with climate change. Land can be rising or sinking regionally, both due to man made and natural phenomena. What you have to look at is eustatic sea level rise to see the effect of glacial melt and thermal expansion of the oceans.	3	1
28	/r/climate/comments/k0te0f/india_only_g20_nation_on_track_to_meet_paris/gdlei8o/	Because they actually see the costs of climate change here in the us it’s just starting to happen	1	1

32	/r/ClimateActionPlan/comments/evqtr8/what_will_it_take_to_stop_climate_change_a/fg0grki/	Earth climate change? No you can't stop it. Man made climate change? Of course you can stop it.	1	1
33	/r/climateskeptics/comments/l1oxzy/_/gk2snwz/	" girl I know. You all are the ""everything's fine, let's not change"" faction of anti germ theorists, insisting that everything is okay and that the new claims are alarmist, while the rest of the world is realizing the truth that climate change (and germs) exist."	1	1
34	/r/climateskeptics/comments/lkhwvk/largescale_commercial_farms_in_the_southern/gnljmcb/	Interesting. So the article saying the human destruction of the rainforest is causing higher temperatures and less rainfall is not indicative of climate change at all to you?	4	1

42	/r/climate/comments/9wvs9o/house_democratic_leader_nancy_pelosi_recommended/eah2tnz/	 Pelosi is in favor of the dnc accepting fossil fuel contributions. If you know anything about Ocasio Cortez, youd know Pelosi isn't doing what aoc wants when it comes to climate change.	2	1
43	/r/ClimateActionPlan/comments/ey67wl/a_group_of_australian_artists_take_to_the_streets/fgftv88/	I absolutely love this. There is no way that’s they would have allowed those ads up legally. The amount of climate change denial is repulsive.	1	1

48	/r/climateskeptics/comments/bknyj6/debunked_global_warming_causes_inequality_nonsense/emilx04/	 Yeah. Those who live in countries that don't give a damn about climate change, are inequally luckier than us.	1	1
49	/r/climateskeptics/comments/ryd0o7/but_butglobal_warming_san_diego_experiencing/hrosyee/	 oh nvm, it's climate change now, not global warming, so yeah, let's all continue to panic and freak out =__=	1	1
50	/r/ClimateActionPlan/comments/i6iqh5/milwaukee_brewers_pitcher_brent_suter_endorses/g0yk2lu/	 A carbon price is needed, but ending capitalism is our only chance to actually address climate change in a meaningful way. Climate change is caused by capitalism, so I don’t have hope for it saving us from it.	2	1
51	/r/climateskeptics/comments/7k1qq8/trump_to_remove_climate_change_from_list_of/drbnjqj/	Discussion in military circles of climate change as a threat multiplier isn't new.	1	1
52	/r/climate/comments/emkb12/its_climate_change_on_top_of_drought_heat_and/fdrj86x/	 Hard, yes but very doable. In fact all through high school I was sure climate change was a hoax. I even gave a speech on it for one of my classes. I now feel the climate is probably the most pressing issue at hand. Edit typo	1	1
53	/r/climateskeptics/comments/d06pju/bipartisan_panel_of_scientists_confirms_humans/ez8d84v/	You don't notice anything strange about figures 1 3 of the following link? They all indicate huge jumps in greenhouse gases.	1	1

55	/r/climate/comments/mez6qd/what_are_the_best_climate_change_podcasts/gsl5vnx/	I was listening to reversing climate change until they had matt one billion americans yglesias on and realized they maybe didn't take the issue that seriously	1	1
56	/r/climateskeptics/comments/jq0tgg/this_years_early_start_to_winter_does_not_negate/gbiysr1/	Sorry. Climate change science says it's beyond debate so it's claims have to be beyond consideration too.	1	1
57	/r/climate/comments/oost76/space_tourism_rockets_emit_100_times_more_co₂_per/h63fjye/	 The CO2 is not the biggest issue with rocket tourism at the moment in reality the amount of flights will be so few it wont amount to much. The problem is the amount of wasted money, expertise and resources that would be better spent addressing climate change here on earth first.	1	1
58	/r/climate/comments/pbad9d/the_time_to_fight_for_pollution_pricing_is_now/hahx1iz/	It's the kind of systemic change scientists say we need.	1	1
59	/r/climateskeptics/comments/8b1d2f/climate_change_it_was_the_sun_all_along_so_say/dx7668e/	There is literally thousands of peer reviewed papers from hundred of fields that show CO2 and other gases like methane are the main contributiors to climate change.	1	1

64	/r/climateskeptics/comments/bteb0n/calling_the_converted/ep7p1hi/	 &gt; almost 120,000 papers on climate change were published. And all of them were wrong too.	1	1
65	/r/climate/comments/mlafjo/climate_anxiety_is_an_overwhelmingly_white/gtktcqe/	 Climate anxiety regarding losing your livelihood, while communities that often face environmental burdens feel the effects of climate change already.	1	1
66	/r/ClimateActionPlan/comments/e0q03n/australias_national_hydrogen_strategy_sets_a/f8hn2st/	Uh huh. Hopium lives. The Aussie conservative govt still denies climate change.	2	1
67	/r/climate/comments/cttghp/this_map_shows_all_the_ongoing_fires_in_south/exp1z58/	 Until this point, it’s been an urgent need/want to get others involved with helping climate change. Now it’s just starting to genuinely piss me off that we’re paying absolutely no attention to this.	1	1
68	/r/climate/comments/euwpbw/bernie_ive_got_seven_grandchildren_ive_got_four/ffsxzbs/	The fossil fuel industry funded psuedo science that says climate change is a hoax. Lock them up	1	-1
69	/r/climate/comments/apuggc/tom_suozzi_moderate_democrat_on_powerful_economic/egbzp6m/	 Your comment is all the more reason to say fuck who doesn’t understand, lets make the best policy based in science and not let our response to climate change be shaped by trying to appeal to everyone	1	1
70	/r/climate/comments/c8od9f/attempts_to_erase_the_science_at_un_talks/esov2et/	Trump and his collusion partners in Russia and Saudi Arabia can try to keep climate change hidden from the public but the death weather from climate change is much too large and loud to keep hidden.	2	1
71	/r/climate/comments/buf17u/again_australia_is_failing_the_world_an_increase/epe83uw/	 I work with people who still try and tell me there is no such thing as climate change and the planet goes through cycles and we can’t do anything about it. Blows my minds, I just assume it’s a choice to be ignorant.	1	1
72	/r/climate/comments/d0jkeb/ted_cruz_gets_schooled_on_twitter_after_showing/ez9xl2b/	Cruz could learn a lot from the climate scientists who worked on man made climate change in the 1960s for Shell and Exxon	1	1
73	/r/climate/comments/q0evu7/migration_will_soon_be_the_biggest_climate/hf7xe8c/	 Actually, no it won't. This is merely a result. The real challenge is preventing the loss of the migrant's homelands to climate change. Nice way to change the narrative though.	1	1
74	/r/ClimateActionPlan/comments/ch8goi/new_zealands_climate_coalition_of_companies/eut2teg/	Can someone explain how this works? Are they donating to causes to reverse climate change? Cause just limit their emissions doesn't stop other companies from heating up the earth	1	1
75	/r/climate/comments/9q2brk/the_arctic_is_turning_green_as_areas_that_have/e87jq93/	Nope. Arctic Amplification will make climate change worse in the North. I think the mid Southern Hemisphere will be the least affected region of the world.	3	1
76	/r/climateskeptics/comments/rcmc81/noaa_1974_global_cooling_will_starve_the_world/hnwzvu8/	 Ah yes Global COOLING, funny how a vast minority know about this. Started off as global cooling in the 70s, then global warming, and now we've arrived at global climate change. People are even starting to forget that it used to global warming.	1	1

78	/r/climate/comments/iuiebe/kamala_harris_sounds_climate_change_alarm_from/g5zqf8k/	 I have tried to sound the alarm about climate change but don't have but a very, very small bully pulpit. I am afraid we may be too late to stop the change before it destroys us.	1	1
79	/r/climatechange/comments/amybbt/any_good_or_uplifting_environmental_or_climate/efqfbfd/	do you accept that a main drive of climate change is manmade CO2?	1	1
80	/r/climate/comments/9ojeev/climate_contrarians_are_refusing_to_pay_up_after/e7vedam/	 Yeah, pretty sure anyone gambling against climate change has problems understanding risks, which probably runs into other issues	1	1
81	/r/climatechange/comments/n8tgi0/new_report_says_china_emits_more_greenhouse/gxmqhxt/	But we can't give a pass to china or any country. China can certainly do more not just give them a pat on the back and say they're doing their part. The excuse of give them 20 years they're still developing just doesn't fly anymore against climate change.	2	1

83	/r/climate/comments/a1rxvv/progressives_say_dire_climate_reports_point_to/easrlbv/	 We need to be focused on climate change first and foremost. The Green New Deal is more of a jobs program than it is a climate policy. If you want a universal basic income, that's fine, but don't derail climate change legislation to push for it.	2	1
84	/r/climatechange/comments/dl3fux/antarctic_ice_cliffs_may_not_contribute_to/f4ocpla/	 Completely agree, that way the climate change deniers can point to it and undermine our arguments /s	1	1

87	/r/ClimateActionPlan/comments/c8h59t/read_my_comment_this_is_big_news_senate_advances/espprvp/	 Funding for research for improved ccs efficiency is not a negative for climate change. It would be a gazillion times better if that funding came from government subsidies, yes, but the investment needs to happen.	2	1
88	/r/climate/comments/r05kkp/what_personally_saddens_you_the_most_about/hlr3r55/	This government wouldn't. A lot of politicians are old and probably won't see the worst impacts from climate change.	2	1
89	/r/climate/comments/rmtqtc/share_your_views/hpp7egk/	 I think climate change will be bad, I just don't think it'll be the whole end civilisation or make humanity extinct levels of severe people tend to make it out. Quality of life will undoubtedly plummet but humans will likely still remain, whether we fix or problems or not.	1	1
90	/r/climate/comments/r05kkp/what_personally_saddens_you_the_most_about/hlri2gx/	 The fact that so many people ‘care’ about climate change, but still participate in high emissions human activities such as animal agriculture, fast fashion, and single use items.	1	1

93	/r/ClimateActionPlan/comments/gqhkzo/woman_creates_self_sufficient_zerowaste/frtgd0i/	This pseudo intellectual again? This stuff isn't helpful to tackle climate change. It produces fuck all food for the land it uses and time it takes. It's like if I built a windmill to power my light bulb and you all saying I'm saving the climate.	1	1
94	/r/climateskeptics/comments/dzcj0s/qantas_manager_blames_increasing_flight_delays_at/f86t202/	 Good to know, I'll just blame climate change every time I come late to work. Or miss an appointment. Or a deadline.	1	1

97	/r/climatechange/comments/7qebqh/how_would_a_ceo_of_a_new_energy_tech_company_feel/dsp13mn/	 Alright. Well, a ceo is obligated by law to maximize shareholder wealth, so an opinion on climate change is probably useful only as a marketing tool for most people who would become CEO.	1	1

99	/r/climateskeptics/comments/cxxqy6/rico_racketeering_probe_beckons_after_michael/eys25ok/	 It's your claim that CO2 is the main driver of climate making you the one to provide evidence. You do not have any evidence that CO2 is either bad, or driving any climate change beyond natural variability. you are the charlatan.	1	1

104	/r/ClimateActionPlan/comments/btdvew/china_makes_arrests_shuts_down_rogue_chemical/eowxs2l/	 Even China sees climate change, and the destruction of the Ozone, as huge threats to themselves and the planet.

As for this specific weather event, many seem to think the destabilization of the polar vortex may be related to climate change. Hard to say so soon though, given the nature of climate science.	1	1
1375	/r/climate/comments/amkpx5/15_year_old_climate_change_activist_girl_with/efnr3xt/	There is a lot of money in denying climate change for people with a reputation. Maybe he wants a piece of the cake.	1	1

I would have thought that's a great reason to support that climate change is happening in the present. Also 'believe' implies some faith or spiritual acceptance.

1974	/r/ClimateActionPlan/comments/o1dspb/russia_and_costa_rica_will_develop_cooperation_in/h25tei0/	You're right. Next time I will simply remove all anti nuclear commentary as anti progress and against the spirit of taking every available action to defeat climate change.	1	1

1990	/r/climateskeptics/comments/a4he0v/bob_tisdale_global_warming_in_perspective/ebhdjwt/	Ice ages aren't mass extinction events.

2009	/r/climateskeptics/comments/q4pdtw/thunderous_new_atmosphere_publication_warming_of/hg59s4e/	 Precisely We were unknowingly perhaps covering up climate change with our pollution levels.

2031	/r/ClimateActionPlan/comments/epp0u3/microsoft_is_taking_initiative_to_be_carbon/fersgsu/	 I mean, I thought climate change has been sort of a foregone conclusion for like 15 years now, and the whole point since then has been mitigation and adaptation.	1	1
2032	/r/ClimateActionPlan/comments/cmfy21/what_can_i_do/ew208fw/	 You can do a lot, but imo you're already doing enough. Talk to people, vote, and continue what you're doing. However I wouldn't take most news outlets super seriously when it comes to climate change. Take everything said on mainstream media with a grain of salt.	2	1
2033	/r/ClimateActionPlan/comments/r9mywc/finally_a_fusion_reaction_has_generated_more/hnj2qq9/	Why is not funded more? Or would more funding not speed up the development? This seems like a trillion dollar tech and possibly the silver bullet to solve climate change.	1	1
2034	/r/climateskeptics/comments/jl0h1u/delhi_india_logs_its_coldest_october_temperature/ganff1o/	Anthropogenic climate change leads to more extreme weather conditions and weather is not the same as climate. It’s really not that hard to understand.	1	1
2035	/r/climate/comments/enbq25/debunked_australian_bushfire_conspiracy_theories/fdzws6r/	" The latest lie that the Murdoch gutter rags are pushing is ""We've never been climate change deniers"". Which, I don't know is that progress?"	1	1
2036	/r/ClimateActionPlan/comments/ev03vi/glasgow_cop26_un_summit_in_november_to_bring_200/ffty79b/	 Fingers crossed. But I'm not really getting my hopes up. Only smaller countries or those directly threatened by climate change, will do the nessesary.	2	1

I don’t believe in CC, but I’d be devastated if Miley doesn’t have kids. We need to do something about cc ASAP.	1	1

2049	/r/climateskeptics/comments/8z1goe/just_came_here_to_laugh_at_this_sub/e2nyx81/	 I would say the more numerate a person is the more they support nuclear power as a permanent solution, but you are on the right track. I wonder, do you stop by subs and laugh at those who claim to be worried about climate change while simultaneously opposing nuclear power?	1	1
2050	/r/climateskeptics/comments/e13gay/the_future/f8o1rf1/	 I think he was right about high deficits ($23 trillion accumulated so far and counting) but quite wrong on NAFTA. But did he say anything about the particular issue at hand; that is, electric cars and climate change?	2	1

2053	/r/climate/comments/8vfhlv/are_we_stuck_with_cement/e1pahjr/	The most difficult part of confronting climate change is finding out that everything you’ve come to know and love about the consumerist capitalist economy has tons and tons of carbon emissions underpinning it.	2	1
2054	/r/climate/comments/cfyy2t/instead_of_spending_15_trillion_on_weapons_to/euemmyg/	Reading the comments on the tweet feed makes me more aware of how f** stupid a lot of Americans are. Those still busy denying climate change and now the climate crisis at their head so far up their @rses that they must be looking at the world through their teeth.	1	1
2055	/r/climatechange/comments/pefzf3/rain_fell_for_the_first_time_on_greenlands_summit/hb5qptl/	Go on to Google scholar and look up papers focusing on Greenland or ipcc links to climate change models. Google Scholar may charge for some articles but most are free PDFs to download.	1	1

2059	/r/climateskeptics/comments/a8dt6w/google_survey_the_world_is_bored_with_climate/ecf5wqr/	 Alarmism, very interesting choice of word. And a wild, unfounded assumption to go with it. Yep, seems about right for a climate change denier.	1	1
2060	/r/ClimateActionPlan/comments/eoqlbc/both_of_these_groups_have_something_in_common/fehgd1y/	 I'm referring to the fact that the fossil fuel industry knew of climate change back in the 70's and proceeded to bury that info and fund denialist propaganda for years to come. The agricultural industry, as far as I know, didn't know any of this.	4	1
2061	/r/climate/comments/dzerzf/news_corps_rupert_murdoch_says_there_are_no/f87nkgm/	 It seems like the climate is barely beginning to become obvious. Given the state of deep deception of his network followers, it seems a doable thing to claim not to be climate change deniers at least until November.	1	1
2062	/r/climate/comments/objw6l/hard_to_comprehend_experts_react_to_record_121/h3q7vx7/	The town is now 90% gone. There aren’t even words to convey the magnitude of what’s coming for us regarding climate change.	1	1
2063	/r/climateskeptics/comments/hinzz7/i_just_want_to_hear_what_you_guys_are_all_about/fwk4z1j/	But carbon is not the only factor in climate change. Carbon may lead to an increase but the carbon concentration was at an all time high in the ice age. More factors are at play here.	1	1
2064	/r/climate/comments/e8g802/dont_let_china_win_the_green_race_america_should/fadeire/	 In the fight against climate change, the only real winner that there should be is the environment. Butttt nooo everything had to be political	2	1

So they're doubling down on destroying the ecosystem and causing catastrophic climate change instead.	1	1
2066	/r/climate/comments/9x282o/brazils_presidential_election_could_mean_billions/e9p6pjx/	 The act of removing people in positions of power that would intentionally exacerbate the global catastrophe of climate change should be seen as an act of heroism.This should be shared en mass, as this will, guaranteed, change your way of living in the near future.	2	1
2067	/r/climate/comments/e1l0bx/supreme_court_lets_lawsuit_by_climate_scientist/f8rp93h/	" It's obvious climate justice will prevail. The fossil fuel industry spent billions to fund climate change lies that have all been debunked. But they kept ""the debate"" open which was all the fossil fuel industry needed to boost profits. Their days are numbered."	1	1
2068	/r/climate/comments/b7tsws/im_planning_suicide/eju6fve/	 Thank you. Is it true humanity can survive it, just that life will suck? I really needed your optimism. I hope we can make a difference. 12 years is actually a long time to do something, and we already are trying to fight climate change.	1	1
2069	/r/climate/comments/puh6o7/this_is_really_sad_and_scary_i_seriously_dont/hebn569/	 If plants don't have the right pH, they will die. Trees are the same. Salt water is too acidic for them. Rising salt water is making their pH out of wack which is killing them. Climate change is making the ocean rise hence saltwater intrusion	4	1

2072	/r/climate/comments/m0d63r/greta_thunberg_urges_biden_to_address_the_climate/gqao5qe/	 Undoing Trump' s dismantling of environmental protections should be a given, not a sign of seriously addresseing climate change. When The us emission falls by over 10% per year, then he's taking it seriously. 0.5% or 1% per year, if that even happens, is a joke.	2	1
2073	/r/climateskeptics/comments/exo59x/well_played_professor/fgf8gho/	That's the worst part of the whole movement. I have a lot more respect for someone who is all in on man made climate change and has also you know done something with their own life that supports their belief.	1	1
2074	/r/climatechange/comments/feqohp/does_my_job_contribute_to_global_warming/fjqhcpc/	Thanks. I’ll check into it here in San Diego. Hmm cheers. Wonder why it’s always recommended in articles to fight climate change.	1	1

2076	/r/climateskeptics/comments/eazpze/just_gonna_leave_this_here/fb34w9k/	 Provide proof that the climate change is man made. And no, models aren't proof. Also, considering we are just coming out of the recent ice age, in which direction are temperatures supposed to move if not up?	1	1
2077	/r/climateskeptics/comments/qtwmd7/_/hkn18y4/	Climate change is that catch all boogeyman to attribute any problem too.	1	1

2080	/r/ClimateActionPlan/comments/p3osr1/how_do_i_communicate_the_gravity_of_the_situation/h8tqb9l/	That phrase is so silly. Climate change isn't about trees. The trees are gonna be fine. It's the humans and the stuff we've built that are unbelievably fucked (on our present course).	4	1
2081	/r/climate/comments/fkp76x/coronavirus_shows_us_rapid_global_response_to/fkucfw3/	 Even more than with a pandemic, by the time wealthy people feel enough pain and fear from climate change to take action, it'll be too late.	1	1
2082	/r/climateskeptics/comments/hyb6gf/drought_rains_and_record_cold_deliver_dismal/fzgc8sa/	 If there is a climate change catastrophe imminent, then the only remedy is a consistent climate. This really would be unprecedented.	1	1

2085	/r/climatechange/comments/gqapu1/my_dad_simply_doesnt_think_humans_cause_climate/frwzmws/	 Global cooling was pushed by the media. The majority of scientists back then still said the earth would warm Also it was the Bush administration that pushed to change the term global warming to climate change, as global warming sounded “too scary”	2	-1
2086	/r/climate/comments/pbv99x/the_cult_of_personal_responsibility_is_killing_us/haf96vc/	 Thank you for posting this. Unfortunately, it may have been posted in error as this article is about mental health. If it mentions climate change somewhere, I may have missed it.	1	1

2092	/r/ClimateActionPlan/comments/e98nb1/college_republicans_launch_campaign_calling_for/fahwyqd/	It's disgusting. So many people have this Red team vs Blue team mentality. I'd thought that anthropogenic climate change was well accepted until it became an issue in American politics.	2	1

2094	/r/climateskeptics/comments/cebbal/it_looks_like_other_climate_change_sites_have/eu2mnnr/	 I see posters throw up pro climate change articles up pretty frequently. They're discussed in the comments, but the posts aren't removed or posters banned. This is just a community. Echo chambers actively police content to encourage an established/agreed upon narrative.	1	1

2100	/r/climateskeptics/comments/bu3piz/climate_change_is_a_political_loser/epeqpfd/	 Not, you but many others. Everything about climate change is a marketing term. The topic wouldn't exist without marketing.	1	1
2101	/r/climate/comments/9e5qvr/no_capitalism_will_not_save_the_climate/e5nbarp/	Oh I'm not an optimist by any stretch. I think billions of people will die as a result of climate change in the coming decades century. But saying it's too late to do anything is even more asinine than just denying climate change in the first place.	1	1

2104	/r/ClimateActionPlan/comments/pmu8c9/weekly_rclimateactionplan_discussion_thread/hckue95/	 Waiting for this Reconciliation Bill to pass is really damn frustrating I mean, I'm grateful that a bona fide climate change denier isn't the President of the United States anymore and that we are making lots of progress; but it is just so tortuous to have the bill so up in the air like this. I'm sure that Manchin and his moderates and the rest of the party will strike a deal somehow, but I just wish we could cut to the chase, and have enough of the posturing.	2	1

3337	/r/climateskeptics/comments/9j1rmw/if_germany_gets_its_oil_from_russia_are_they/e6o41m1/	Most of the environmentalist and climate change awareness movements are financed by Russian money.	2	1
3338	/r/ClimateActionPlan/comments/bgce5e/india_to_set_up_12_more_nuclear_plants/elq2ynr/	 Gas is a step in the right direction, but really we need to scale up zero carbon energy as fast as humanly possible. Nuclear has to be the leader in that regard for us to have a chance at defeating climate change.	1	1
3339	/r/climate/comments/j5amr7/trees_are_growing_fast_and_dying_young_due_to/g7rz8he/	Facts. Biden's climate change plan is great.	2	1

3341	/r/climateskeptics/comments/ak4mlg/chicago_is_colder_than_parts_of_antarctica_alaska/ef34q48/	 That's exactly why they call it climate change. It says nothing about attribution, or whether it's cooling or warming. The unwashed, uninformed sheeple just assume it's catastrophic and man made.	1	1
3342	/r/climateskeptics/comments/h7afkk/here_we_go_again/fukrp0l/	 Well, one source did. And no surprise that it was The Copernicus Climate Change Service, a department of the EU. If you dare believe what they say, you’ll believe a statement from the Tobacco Industry claiming smoking isn’t harmful.	2	1
3343	/r/climate/comments/rqum9k/how_do_i_explain_the_seriousness_of_climate/hqfc0ev/	Coal isn't the cheapest energy. Solar is. And solar is getting cheaper every year. Coal has serious external costs due to pollution and climate change. The citizens of Beijing wear wearing masks due to air pollution long before Covid.	1	1

3348	/r/climate/comments/bqhwqz/jay_inslee_is_writing_the_climate_plan_the_next/eo65ltt/	 This is spot on. No one in the presidential field is addressing climate change with the urgency that is needed, which begins with telling the truth about the severity of the climate crisis and the existential risk it poses to humanity and the global ecology.	2	1

3353	/r/climateskeptics/comments/88lxvq/the_great_easter_washout/dwmtnmg/	I don't believe you're allowed to say that it's climate change because you will be meteorologically appropriating alarmist culture.	1	1
3354	/r/climate/comments/b9vp3f/whats_the_most_important_thing_we_need_to_change/ek7dde9/	 People. We need to educaute people about climate change, what it is and what it does. Before that they don’t have a reason to change their habits. We also need to educate people about overconsumption, habitat destruction, waste, air pollution and 6th mass extinction.	1	1

3366	/r/climateskeptics/comments/evv336/if_the_science_is_settled_why_are_climatologists/ffy8hhc/	 Because they study climate not necessarily climate change.

I’ve seen a lot of posts about reduced air pollution and NO2 in Asia and other place.

3843	/r/climateskeptics/comments/rjoik1/arrest_the_climate_deniers/hp5z8ug/	 Yea, the climate change movement shows all the signs of a cult.	1	1
3844	/r/climateskeptics/comments/bguiqo/climate_change_the_maldives_mystery/elothsu/	&gt; I hear and read it all the time. And you're trying to say that statement is incorrect? Absolutely. Sea level rise is a problem after catastrophic climate change happens. 2100 and beyond.	3	1

3847	/r/climate/comments/i2wxml/its_time_for_the_us_to_reassert_climate/g09ban0/	 lol dude please delete this before you get absolutely roasted for the (implicit) suggestion that the answer to climate change is more white dudes with glasses and beards starting podcasts like i get your point but also, lol	1	1

3849	/r/climateskeptics/comments/lhplh0/41_record_lows_set_in_alberta_as_britain_suffers/gmzqphg/	Lol people still believe that climate change is only about warmer temperatures?	1	1
3850	/r/climate/comments/b29mc7/finnish_scientists_factcheck_climate_media_claims/eirw629/	 Except that the article referenced here fact checked her and found that her claims are accurate. Now, accurate facts may be alarming, which in the case of climate change is definitely true. So are you arguing that if the truth is alarming, we shouldn’t state it?	1	1
3851	/r/climateskeptics/comments/r7djib/study_finds_atlantic_hurricanes_becoming_more/hmym10w/	" This comes after Michael Mann and others had to recant the ""climate change = more hurricanes"" scare tactic, after years of declining numbers.

3856	/r/climateskeptics/comments/rq0nra/if_you_look_at_the_timelines_for_the_last_ice_age/hq915nw/	Climate change is caused by 3rd world countries.	2	1

3859	/r/climate/comments/d5uy0s/indians_doing_it_right/f0ozmrn/	 I can understand why Saudi Arabia would be in denial, to admit manmade climate change would be to admit that you are the facilitator of the destruction of an earth that your god gave you to look after.	1	1

3868	/r/climate/comments/bm5cmc/us_is_hotbed_of_climate_change_denial_major/emus97r/	 Well this talk about climate change, officials from the united nations have came out and admitted it is being used to discredit and attack the capitalist/freemarket.

4051	/r/ClimateActionPlan/comments/jo1mry/i_think_this_fits_here/gb51q7z/	 It really, really doesn't. Pretty much everyone here already knows this and that's why this sub was created to show the actions being made to combat climate change.	1	1

4054	/r/climateskeptics/comments/adscpq/lee_harding_climate_conformity_may_well_bury_the/edjstcc/	 &gt;Climate change alarmists have become the Roman Inquisition of the 21st century. Once again, the Earth is put at the centre of everything, with other issues such as free speech, democracy and scientific freedom relegated to some distant orbit.	2	1
4055	/r/climate/comments/jyz4gk/trump_slams_global_climate_agreement_biden/gdbtwbp/	I reread it yesterday. While not perfect it does imho recognize the global aspect of climate change.	1	1
4056	/r/climatechange/comments/9guw7p/so_what_do_you_think_is_going_to_happen/e67uj6z/	 I guess I should state this literally The endgame for climate change is that the climate will become a tunable environment, like your bedroom probably is now. But I consider that a strictly 22nd century solution. It won't be a success witnessed by anybody alive today.	1	1

Sounds like they're mostly staffed with way more political activists than medical professionals.	2	1
4059	/r/climateskeptics/comments/air6j2/new_ocean_warming_paper_contains_factual_errors/eeq1vym/	 Yes but it's probably climate change that's responsible for the errors in climate change papers. agw is causing health problems that can lead to deficits in fact checking, graph making, and basic arithmetic. We really need to do something about this soon.	1	1
4060	/r/climateskeptics/comments/m63k5f/us_surface_temperatures_drop_to_the_lowest_in/gr50oy4/	 Last time I checked climate change goes to both extremes (hot and cold) It means more extreme weather, not a warmer or colder climate overall.	1	1
4061	/r/climatechange/comments/ff6sb3/need_help_finding_anti_climate_change_articles/fk0poxr/	 It probably won’t be much help though since almost none of them give concrete studies other than “petitions” that a couple scientists signed, and they take that as proof that climate change is bull. Also the petitions have been debunked but that doesn’t matter to them.	1	1

4067	/r/ClimateActionPlan/comments/oyv0jp/the_vanishing_beach/h7vlz9o/	 This doesn't seem to show any action being taken about climate change, just some bad news. Am I missing something?	1	1

4069	/r/climateskeptics/comments/bivxlm/honest_question_for_climate_activists_what/em3vg86/	I’m not a huge activist although I do understand climate change. I would assume motivation from most would be to educate which could eventually get enough people on board to mitigate damage that is happening. People want a world for their kids that’s worth living	1	1
4070	/r/climate/comments/opbtyf/no_need_for_new_fossil_fuels_anywhere_in_world/h67yy7q/	 I think this list of necessary changes to limit CO2 emissions, while seemingly reasonable, needs sources to be credible. Also, this problem isn’t all or nothing. Lower emissions also lower the probability of more severe catastrophes as a result of climate change.	1	1
4071	/r/climate/comments/c22zbp/national_climate_emergency_declared_by_canadas/erj5jtz/	 The party who is the most likely to win our federal election this year is comprised of and led by climate change deniers. If they win, they will undo as much climate legislation as possible.	2	1

4077	/r/ClimateActionPlan/comments/iv09zx/how_do_you_guys_deal_with_news_like_place_is_on/g5pmh5o/	 I would also consider going to therapy. Not because climate change anxiety isn’t rational, but because I think there are a lot of healthy ways to deal with it and therapy might be useful in finding those ways.	1	1

4091	/r/climate/comments/dz7cfv/governments_are_planning_to_produce_120_more/f85oxi3/	 Pretty sobering and depressing report. Governments around the world aren't just failing to address the climate change crisis, they are actively making it worse.	2	1

4096	/r/climate/comments/belhe3/talking_about_climate_change_in_conservative/el6pe4r/	 In my experience, getting an opportunity to speak on climate change in conservative places is nearly impossible. They simply refuse to hear it.	2	1
4097	/r/climate/comments/qf6h17/should_i_save_for_retirement/hi1603i/	 We were but there all ppl had to do to not die was not press the nuclear launch button, whereas climate change needs the collapse of capitalism to have something done abkjt it	2	1
4098	/r/climate/comments/ckui8m/looking_for_efficient_sources_of_information_that/evqofz2/	I like that. It would need to be supplemented with something that explained the dangers of climate change. No one is be dealing with would probably be a skeptic so much as but realize just how dangerous it is. I think I'll add that to my op for clarification.	1	1
4099	/r/climatechange/comments/jbtvxa/how_us_corn_farmers_adapted_to_climate_change/g91pvir/	 Literally the last paragraph in the article &gt;“The story that we can just adapt ourselves out of climate change is not the one that we’re telling here,” Butler said.	1	1

If you don't think that world is on the brink of catastrophe, then what do you think is the climate change all about and what do you suggest we do to reverse whatever is happening?	1	1
4104	/r/climate/comments/b5mjfs/on_tuesday_klawock_alaska_topped_out_at_70/ejg243v/	But one cold day and Trump’ll come back at you with a “Where’s the climate change now?”	2	1
4105	/r/climate/comments/9sftv9/caravan_provides_a_preview_of_climate_migrations/e8ofwsw/	You can't continue to deny climate change and then get made at the repercussions.	1	1
4106	/r/climate/comments/p5ig13/the_gulf_stream_is_nearing_a_critical_point_of/h9761eb/	 It’s not mitigated, it’s just different. Global systems are more complex than warm=bad, cool=good. The global north will still feel the effects of climate change, and that utilitarian perspective has justified global south exploitation for hundreds of years.	1	1
4107	/r/climateskeptics/comments/jjt0sh/record_snow_and_ice_in_the_us/gaghwh1/	 No, I think it's part of climate change. Scientists call it that because they acknowledge the climate can and will get colder. Snow is cold so it can't global warming.	3	1
4108	/r/climate/comments/d1ryar/the_lifestyles_of_the_42_million_richest_people/ezve3wx/	Thank you. I hope I have more influence than I think. The house is not mine. I live with family.

4111	/r/climatechange/comments/fk7j4k/corona_virus_and_climate_change/fkr7430/	 Any link between covid 19 and climate change would be purely speculatory by this point. In other words, we just don't know enough yet to make an informed connection between the two.	1	1
4113	/r/climateskeptics/comments/r853mr/religious_groups_can_help_combat_climate_change/hn3l2j6/	Maybe climate change nazis should just renounce their “religion” because at this point it’s far less believable than the existence of an all powerful deity	1	1

4117	/r/climate/comments/a6b333/california_requires_new_city_buses_to_be_electric/ebu8biw/	 California is doing far more than this and you don’t have to look very hard to find that out. You can accuse them of a lot of things, pretending to care about climate change is not one of them.	1	1

4119	/r/climate/comments/bpc6p2/im_voting_for_the_first_time_in_2020_this_has_to/enteze4/	There wasn't a single question about climate change during the 2016 Democratic debates.	2	1
4121	/r/climateskeptics/comments/jd8f0f/introducing_people_to_thinking_differently_about/g99kbfn/	I think you would have to define what the consensus is. Very broadly there is consensus (it appears to me) that the climate changes. Yet little consensus that the only cause of climate change is the CO2 humans have emitted since the begining of the industrial revolution.	1	1
4122	/r/climate/comments/ouizcs/climate_change_has_become_real_extreme_weather/h75pf3b/	 Ever heard of the concept of “rate of change”? It’s too fast for the animal life and plant life to deal with.

4127	/r/climate/comments/if6dh7/joe_biden_recommits_to_ending_fossil_fuel/g2n1sxj/	 I'm not pessimistic, I'm realistic. The Democrats are not willing to do what it takes to combat climate change. The kind of change that is necessary to preserve the future of industrial civilization cannot occur within our political system.	2	1

5411	/r/climateskeptics/comments/m2w6rd/over_the_past_30_years_there_have_been_dozens_of/gqp762e/	 CO2 is a miracle gas. It helps plants grow. If there was enough CO2 in the atmosphere we could solve world hunger, far from the doomsday prophecies climate change theorists proclaim. We should be subsidizing carbon, not taxing it. What a backwards society we live in these days.	4	1

5413	/r/climateskeptics/comments/pq8bpe/why_australia_shouldnt_stop_at_subs_how_atomic/hd9rbmw/	 Atomic power will not affect climate change, because CO2 has almost no effect on the climate. Mining and burning coal is messy. Australia is best to have wholesale fracking and burn gas to generate power, and abandon wind turbines and solar panels completely.	2	1

5419	/r/ClimateActionPlan/comments/oxugon/in_vancouver_all_parking_lots_in_new_hotels_and/h90htfu/	You see the hyperloop in Vegas and tell me that it's good for climate change. The man wants to push us further into car reliance. He's greenwashed to shit.	1	1

5421	/r/climate/comments/cr79dh/no_industry_will_be_impacted_by_climate_change/ex2ckya/	Also agriculture holds the key to mitigate climate change. No other industry has the potential to store similar amounts of carbon quickly.	4	1

Thats when it hit me that climate change is probably as bad as they say it is/will be.	5	1

5428	/r/climateskeptics/comments/c9z4cd/chernobyl_miniseries_is_global_warming_propaganda/et5qazo/	 So which government is denying climate change? Last I checked every government on earth is busy spending billions on climate change propaganda, including the US. The truth will indeed catch up	2	1
5429	/r/climate/comments/rkp8k5/really_abnormal_storms_and_tornadoes_tear_through/hpf3pb1/	The climate alarmists tried and were proven wrong when they attempted to link hurricanes to climate change and now they are doing the same here without a single shred of evidence.	5	1

5563	/r/climate/comments/976amc/stop_despairing_and_do_something_about_climate/e46yt34/	 Give me a fucking break. Climate change has been laughed at and marginalized for literally decades, the media never gave a shit and barely covers it now.

5961	/r/climateskeptics/comments/7cxw03/skepticism_requires_high_cognitive_ability_strong/dptyot1/	 I mean, the author of this study explicitly talks about climate change skepticism as an example of conspiracy theorising and unfounded belief, in which participants lack that motivation to be rational.	1	1
5962	/r/climateskeptics/comments/lhplh0/41_record_lows_set_in_alberta_as_britain_suffers/gmzbfvf/	 No, record cold weather is also proof of climate change. Heavy rains and flooding are caused by climate change. Drought is caused by climate change. It's very simple. Any and all meteorological events are caused by man made climate change.	5	1

5964	/r/climate/comments/qf6h17/should_i_save_for_retirement/hi0eufm/	 Not true. Climate change has been a known major issue since the 70s. My generation (born in 1981) was climate change, and the Y2K issue. The previous generation had the Cold War. Which was way worse than anything going on today.	1	1

Did %97 of climatologists agree with the idea that man made climate change presented a problem in any way, much less something we needed to take drastic action on? Obama's original tweet on this was absolute FUD, and so was Al Gore's film.	2	1

6366	/r/ClimateActionPlan/comments/kag5ht/japans_government_to_run_on_30_renewable_power/ghdz3x6/	 So till then, will we see any significant impacts of climate change? In terms of food supply, climate refugees etc?	1	1
6367	/r/climate/comments/f67psu/japan_in_the_face_of_climate_change_is_building/fi4ox1h/	And so is Germany	2	1
6368	/r/climate/comments/bm5cmc/us_is_hotbed_of_climate_change_denial_major/emvqs5e/	And he's a transplanted Aussie. Lots of blokes down under deny climate change. At least their government doesn't deny it.	2	1
6369	/r/climate/comments/c90w09/without_climate_action_economic_growth_will_be/esscf5b/	" There are so many opportunities to look incredulous and say, ""Ya think?"" when it comes to people talking about the effects of climate change. This would be one of those."	1	1
6370	/r/climateskeptics/comments/rx4aga/arctic_ice_sees_18year_high_for_january_3rdalso/hrgpzyl/	 Yeah maybe, but it's a much drier, less dense ice, inferior quality to the stuff in the 1800s. It's climate change ice, not the ol' good stuff back when CO2 was only 300 ppm. So it doesn't count.	3	1
6371	/r/climate/comments/ble6z7/new_study_climate_education_for_kids_increases/emoz5i6/	 Good. Readin, writtin and climate change word problems as an intro to STEM.	1	1
6372	/r/climateskeptics/comments/k69b7f/i_think_were_all_dead_now/geniip2/	Sorry busy at bank cashing my huge Climate Change Denier check	1	1
6373	/r/climate/comments/hk88un/murdoch_press_supports_reformed_climate_activist/fws91r4/	 He really downplays how serious the issue is &gt;Climate change is real, but it's not the end of the world. It's not even our most important environmental problem. Is this what climate change denial is going to be replaced with?	1	1
6374	/r/climatechange/comments/dhhukh/we_cant_convince_deniers_with_facts/f3ob0u4/	There is no evidence. Simple common sense can be used to kill man made climate change.	1	1
6375	/r/climateskeptics/comments/js62mw/uk_extinction_rebellion_activists_hijack_the/gbxsgmu/	" ""Climate change means war""? Time to start bombing Chinese coal plants I guess."	1	1
6376	/r/climatechange/comments/dhlw3m/earth_will_cross_the_climate_danger_threshold_by/f3pa4h7/	 Tell me again how you're more of an expert on climate change than Michael Mann, random unstable internet dude. See, the thing about using appeal to authority (the thing you're failing at), is you have to have some authority. You don't.	1	1
6377	/r/climateskeptics/comments/94d0tu/why_is_climate_change_denial_so_interwound_with/e3p8pdn/	 I understand what you want to do, but it isn't democratic to force your ideas on people like that. You wanted to know why conservatives are against climate change policy, now you know.	2	1
6378	/r/climateskeptics/comments/a1rcrs/un_secretary_rise_of_nationalism_threatens/easy5z5/	" The un does not exist to ""fight"" climate change. They exist to keep the peace. And they've failed miserably at that. Defund the UN."	2	1
6379	/r/climateskeptics/comments/l1oxzy/_/gk2f8k1/	 Why is this a bad thing? Youth need to be educated on the dangers of climate change, and I thought you guys were all about the right to free speech	1	1
6380	/r/ClimateActionPlan/comments/cbapzl/announcing_the_fuck_rcollapse_nff_fundraiser/ett4zjz/	 Also I kind of notice you have the wrong idea about climate change, specifically where you think we have no hope. Why is that? What's your reasoning?	1	1
6381	/r/ClimateActionPlan/comments/ebp68z/iconic_florida_keys_reefs_primed_for_100_million/fb7mm4s/	We need short term mitigation. Reefs play an essential role in.sustaining biodiversity which helps bigger against climate change	4	1
6382	/r/climatechange/comments/b1kkoj/why_do_some_people_believe_that_climate_change_is/eioeovq/	" I am outright stating that a great many supposed solutions to climate change have involved companies that are very much like Theranos. Have a look at all the ""green"" companies, backed by federal grants and/or loan guarantees, that have failed. Solyndra is not a unique case."	2	1
6383	/r/climate/comments/gdayih/south_korea_tackled_the_coronavirus_now_its/fphj8fg/	 It's really great that competent, civilized nations are stepping up to lead the world. Especially since major nations like America, Australia, Russia, the U.K. etc. are all miserable failures who choose not to handle things like climate change or humane policies.	2	1
6384	/r/climate/comments/expwxx/the_amount_of_methane_presently_leaking_into_the/fge4ati/	Science adjusts to new information. This doesn't mean climate change suddenly isn't happening	1	1
6385	/r/ClimateActionPlan/comments/inhnrx/weekly_rclimateactionplan_discussion_thread/g4a8hje/	The lack of politics seems silly echoing secretfurryacount many of the solutions to climate change are going to be political especially to start with.	2	1
6386	/r/climateskeptics/comments/7kq7eb/trump_drops_climate_change_from_national_security/drgg0wu/	Think of all the poor journalists and reddit alarmists who can no longer smugly claim that even the military sees climate change as a threat.	1	1
6387	/r/climate/comments/c7ybti/precipitous_fall_in_antarctic_sea_ice_revealed/esi7n5y/	 It´s so sad to see that the whole climate change problem is getting so politicised. We are in huge danger but we can definetly get a hold of it if we are united and take action ASAP. Please do your share by informing yourself, your family and your friends time is running out	2	1
6388	/r/climate/comments/fle8ak/small_energy_is_solution_to_climate_change_read/fky2yh5/	" This appears to be a link to a single image saying ""climate change solution"" which isn't terribly useful or interesting. Removed."	1	1
6389	/r/climate/comments/f8ubf1/mirroring_the_climate_denial_conspiracy_theories/fipywg3/	 Climate change, religion, immigration, gender, bla bla bla, Stop all debate, block and de platform all and best of all deny any debate . wow . That sounds like a great idea. Good luck in your future, glad I’ve only a few years left.	1	1
6390	/r/climateskeptics/comments/ia3qjl/reliance_on_wind_and_solar_will_lead_to_blackouts/g1mxd3h/	 &gt; This isn't an argument against climate change acceptance The argument against that is made by the recent Pew, Harris and Gallup polls. Climate alarm ranks dead last. It's time for alarmists to start thinking about their futures.	1	1
6391	/r/climateskeptics/comments/ag2kp5/so_do_you_guys_think_human_activities_have/ee3ezga/	Ok let’s assume you’re right there’s a pro climate change agenda and it’s responsible for all of the scientific studies. What has that agenda accomplished to date? What is its end goal?	1	1
6392	/r/climate/comments/pbea20/climate_change_is_driving_couples_to_skip_having/haf24pz/	That’s how it became “human induced climate change” in the first place people not thinking long term and responsibly but instead selfishly wanting kids and destroying the environment for happiness in their lifetime.	1	1
6393	/r/climatechange/comments/dqsm88/distressing_photos_show_glaciers_that_are/f6bb4rw/	 Don't feed the denier troll. From the handle (if he's not a bot) he seems quite young, so will get to see first hand the dire consequences of unchecked climate change. But will he renounce his previous denialism? Nah he'll brazenly continue as before. Don't waste your time.	1	1
6394	/r/climate/comments/lpq4n8/john_kerry_says_earth_has_9_years_to_avert_the/gocthts/	I guess the real question is will the news media frame climate change as real or are they still helping the deniers.	1	1
6395	/r/climateskeptics/comments/q6zm3o/the_duality_of_climate_change_im_sure_early/hgiuldy/	Once again nothing to do with climate change. More fake news and propaganda. Ski resort is in the tropics and you think its climate change. I have some land on the moon id love to sell you	1	-1

""Aw shit, we better get this global warming shit solved asap."""	1	1
6397	/r/climate/comments/e9thfl/trump_tells_teen_climate_activist_greta_thunberg/falgxby/	 Yes You tell her Trump Greta such an idiot, there is no climate change.	2	1
6398	/r/ClimateActionPlan/comments/jcf8vv/is_it_true_that_carbon_emmisons_and_shit_is_due/g90zxup/	Individual action is of course important but 71% of emissions are from just 100 companies.	1	1
